                    <p>Our journey began 15 years ago when Maria Rodriguez had a vision of creating a restaurant that
                        celebrated diversity in culinary traditions.
                        What started as a modest eatery has now blossomed into a vibrant culinary destination, thanks to
                        the hard work and dedication of our passionate team.

                    <h2>Our Culinary Philosophy</h2>
                    <p>At Buddha Corner, we are proud to offer a diverse menu that reflects the rich tapestry of
                        global cuisine.
                        Our chefs are artisans, blending traditional techniques with modern creativity to craft dishes
                        that are both authentic and innovative.
                        Whether you crave the bold spices of Indian curry, the delicate flavors of Japanese sushi, or
                        the comfort of American classics, our menu has something to satisfy every palate.

                        sourced ingredients whenever possible.
                        These high-quality ingredients, combined with our commitment to authenticity, ensure that every
                        dish is a true culinary masterpiece.
